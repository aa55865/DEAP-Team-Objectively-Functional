Instructions:
1. The user-defined parameters such as: X,Y,Z and objective functions should be entered in the test.py file
2. Run deapSolver.py. The deapSolver.py file contains the solver implementation using Mu Plus Lambda evolutionary algorithm. 
3. Run test.py containing the problem.
4. The output table contains the value of the variables for each generation, and the fitness values related to each of these variables calculated by the DEAP algorithm.
